# Portfolio #2

* This website is my second portfolio made in the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This web page is a great improvement from the first one I made and I utilized many of the skills I have gained in the last 3 weeks in this project. I used some basic JQuery to append elements to the DOM via a onClick event, and also to change text on the screen based on the current carousel slide. My CSS skills have also improved through the use of some bootstrap, along with deciding on a clean color scheme that is easy to read a layout where it is easy to find the important content on my page.
